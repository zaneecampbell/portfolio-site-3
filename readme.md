UPDATED VERSION IN PORTFOLIO-FINAL

This is my 3rd rebuild of a portfolio site.
It uses React for a front-end, and Material-UI for styling.
This will always be a WIP as I create and add more portfolio pieces.
Future features ideas are listed at the bottom of the respective code for the components this is still WIP.

This was my first real attempt at using Material-UI and launching a proper webpage. Most things are interactive in some way.
